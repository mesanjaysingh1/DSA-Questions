An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3

Idea: Divide n continuosly by 2,3,5 to remove all its factor. Atlast if n==1 that means it had only 2,3 or 5 factors else it has some other prime factor in it as / by
2,3, 5 removes all non prime factors from it.

TC:O(log n)

class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int n) {
        if(n<0) return false;
        while(n>1){
            if(n%2==0) n/=2;
            else if(n%3==0) n/=3;
            else if(n%5==0) n/=5;
            else  return false;
        }
        return n==1;
    }
}
