You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


Example 1:

Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Idea: First assume that we have no money, so buy1 means that we have to borrow money from others, we want to borrow less so that 
we have to make our balance as max as we can(because this is negative).

sell1 means we decide to sell the stock, after selling it we have price[i] money and we have to give back the money we owed, 
so we have price[i] - |buy1| = prices[i ] + buy1, we want to make this max.

buy2 means we want to buy another stock, we already have sell1 money, so after buying stock2 we have buy2 = sell1 - price[i] money left, 
we want more money left, so we make it max

sell2 means we want to sell stock2, we can have price[i] money after selling it, and we have buy2 money left before, so sell2 = buy2 + prices[i], we make this max.

So sell2 is the most money we can have.

        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            buy1=Math.max(buy1,-prices[i]); //buy at least price
            sell1 = Math.max(sell1,prices[i]+buy1); // profit buy sell and prev owned give back
            buy2 = Math.max(buy2,sell1-prices[i]);// next buy & some money left from prev sell
            sell2 = Math.max(sell2,prices[i]+buy2);
        }
        return sell2;
    }
