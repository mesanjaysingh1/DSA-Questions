Desc: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Idea:  Inc right ptr till it is diff from r-1. Then store it at left ptr and inc left by 1 for next element.

TC:O(n) SC:O(1)

class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int l=1,n=nums.length;
        for(int r=1;r<n;r++){
            if(nums[r]!=nums[r-1]){nums[l]=nums[r];l++;}
        }
        return l;
    }
}
